Online check‑in means you can save time and fuss at the airport by checking in for your Hakuna
flight via the website prior to your arrival at the airport.

Online check‑in is available 48 hours before your flight’s scheduled departure time. It closes
90 minutes before scheduled departure for all passengers who have an eticket.

If you are departing from Dubai, you can drop off your bags 24 hours before departure, or 12
hours before departure if you’re flying to the US.

Please note that online check‑in is not available if the first flight in your itinerary is not
an Hakuana flight. This applies to all codeshare flights that are not operated by Emirates.
