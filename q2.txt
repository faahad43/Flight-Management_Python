While you can still check‑in online, you won’t be able to print or use a mobile boarding

pass at this time. We’ll give you your boarding pass at the airport

check‑in counters once you’ve presented the health and travel documents required

by your destination. Please make sure that you have all the appropriate

documents ready before you go to the airport.
