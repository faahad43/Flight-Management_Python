If you selected and paid for your seat, you can change to another seat of equal valuefor free or choose a higher
value seat by paying the difference. If you changed to a higher value seat and were charged the full amount, our
team will automatically refund the difference.If you change to a lower value seat, we will not be able to refund
you the difference.

If you’ve made changes to your flight number or flight date, but are travelling on the original sector, you can
choose new seats of equal value for free. However, we will not be able to refund you if you’ve made changes to
your sector, if seats of the same value aren’t available, or if seat selection isn’t available on your new flight.
